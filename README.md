# ClusteringGroupOfMachines
:sparkles::fireworks::tada: Important points about this Repository!!!!! :tada::fireworks::sparkles:

* This Repository has been created for the **Winter Project** for Open Source under **Developer Student Club SLOP** Program.
* The project is to be based on **Machine Learning** or **Deep Learning**.
* Any other technology can be used if it is required. For example, Cloud Computing knowledge can be used if the machines are running on cloud.

# Aim of this Project
* This project aims to use Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms to group some machines/systems based on the resource usage.

# Action Plan
* One script is to be constructed in this project, in which the main function will take one argument(an Integer number), & that argument signifies the number of machine which has to clustered using any Machine Learning or Deep Learning Algorithm.

* The script which has to be created, must have the capability to select the given number of machines which are having most of their resources free among the total machines running anywhere.

* Any way/technology can be used to retrieve the metrics of the machine which are running, & those metrics has to be used to identify the machines with most of their resources free using any Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms.

* After identifying the machines, their public IP Addresses (if on cloud, or local IP Address if in a local network) should be returned by the script.
