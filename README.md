# ClusteringGroupOfMachines
:sparkles::fireworks::tada: Important points about this Repository!!!!! :tada::fireworks::sparkles:

* This Repository has been created for the **Winter Project** for Open Source under **Developer Student Club SLOP** Program.
* The project is to be based on **Machine Learning**.

# Aim of this Project
* This project aims to use Machine Learning algorithms to group some machines/systems based on the resource usage.

* One script is to be constructed in this project, in which the main function will take one argument(an Integer number), & that argument signifies the number of machine which has to clustered using any Machine Learning or Deep Learning Algorithm.
